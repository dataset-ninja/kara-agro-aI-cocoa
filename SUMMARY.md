**The KaraAgroAI Cocoa Dataset** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the agricultural industry. 

The dataset consists of 11978 images with 21712 labeled objects belonging to 8 different classes including *cocoa-swollen-shoot-virus-leaf*, *anthracnose-leaf*, *healthy-cocoa-leaf*, and other: *healthy-cocoa-pod*, *anthracnose pod*, *cocoa-swollen-shoot-virus-pod*, *healthy-cocoa*, and *cocoa-swollen-shoot-virus-stem*.

Images in the KaraAgro AI Cocoa dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 2 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 3 health statuses: ***cssvd*** (5806 images), ***anthracnose*** (3215 images), and ***healthy*** (2957 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">University of Ghana</span>.
