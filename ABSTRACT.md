The **The KaraAgroAI Cocoa Dataset** was created by authors to provide an open and accessible Cocoa dataset with well-labeled, sufficiently curated, and prepared Cocoa crop imagery that will be used by data scientists, researchers, the wider machine learning community, and social entrepreneurs within Sub-saharan Africa and worldwide for various machine learning experiments so as to build solutions towards in-field Cocoa crop disease diagnosis and spatial analysis.

## Motivation

Despite the fact that the agricultural sector is a national economic development priority in Sub-Saharan Africa, crop pests and diseases have been the challenge affecting major food security crops like cocoa. Cocoa Swollen Shoot Virus Disease (CSSVD) can substantially reduce yield by about 70% and even cause the death of cocoa trees within 2–3 years of infection at all stages of cocoa growth. It is one of the major disease problems affecting cocoa production in West Africa, most especially, in Ghana, Côte D’Ivoire, Nigeria, and Togo. Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum lupini, is the world's most important lupin disease. The current state of data collection and crop pest and disease diagnosis is transitioning from disease identification using visible symptoms to the use of data-driven solutions applying machine learning and computer vision techniques. The image data previously collected is biased and not reproducible It has also not been sufficiently curated, prepared, and shared with the wider community.

## Dataset Creation

The dataset was created to provide an open, well-labelled, sufficiently curated and accessible cocoa image dataset. Data scientists, researchers, and the broader machine learning community can use it for various machine learning experiments to build cocoa crop disease diagnosis and spatial analysis solutions. The dataset was created by a team of data scientists, agricultural scientists and agricultural officers from the KaraAgro AI Foundation, with support from the University of Ghana - Forest and Horticultural Crops Research Centre, Kade. It contains different instances that were captured across all the 7 cocoa growing regions of Ghana. The data associated with each instance was acquired from cocoa farms. These were different farms that were identified within the districts of the 7 cocoa growing prominent regions across the country. The data was collected using the KaraAgro AI - Collect app, a software program that uses a module that enables crowdsourcing of crop disease surveillance data from farms. This application was installed on Android devices. Data collectors used these Android devices to collect the cocoa data. This data was collected in a period of 4 months from September 2021 to December 2021. Each instance is associated with a class label based on the status of the crop i.e. diseased or healthy.
